    <h1>My Favorite City is Seattle!</h1>
    <p><h4>Seattle (Listeni/siˈætəl/) is a seaport city on the west coast of the United States and the seat of King County, Washington. With an estimated 686,800 residents as of 2016,[3] Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. In July 2013, it was the fastest-growing major city in the United States[7] and remained in the Top 5 in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2.1%.[8] The city is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canada–United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2015.</h4></p>
